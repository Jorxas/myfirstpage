# My First Web Page  

## Introduction  
This project is my first web page, designed to test my skills in pure **html** and ** css**, which I acquired through university courses and LinkedIn certifications.  

Initially, I intended it to be my **portfolio**, but I now plan to develop it later when I have mastered all the necessary skills.  

## Project Details  
- The page consists of a **single layout** with buttons that navigate between different sections.  
- It is **not yet responsive** but will be improved in the future.  
- The main idea is to:  
  - **Introduce myself**  
  - Display **images** that will act as links to my future projects  
  - Include a **contact form** with links to my **social media**  

This is just the beginning, and I look forward to improving it as I gain more experience!
